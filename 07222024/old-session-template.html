      will share her personal story of forgiveness &ndash; how it came into her
      life, how it changed her body, and how it became a central tenet of her
      healing and activism. Through a multimedia and interactive presentation,
      Leah will invite participants to consider: your own relationship to
      forgiveness, how your body may or may not be a ffected by that
      relationship, and what might happen if forgiveness should enter your life.
      Leah will share tools for the practice of forgiveness in personal,
      relational, and professional settings.
