      In the United States, approximately 19% of adolescents experience offline
      dating violence (ADV), and approximately the same percentage of teens
      experience online dating violence . This violence has serious health
      consequences, including eating disorders, depression, a nxiety, suicidal
      ideation, and homicide. Further, ADV is a predictor of adult-perpetrated
      re lational violence. Emerging research on ADV equips anti-violence
      professionals with a uni que opportunity for intervention that may assist
      in the eradication of later perpetrated viol ence, particularly if efforts
      are directed toward youth offenders. This discussion will focus on
      understanding the primary components of ADV, the neurobiological
      underpinnings for youth perpetration, and what you can do about it. This
      discussion will provide you with sp ecific interventions for youth, along
      with tools for advocating within your community.
