      <a href="https://www.towardsthesun.org" target="_blank">Leah Zeiger</a>
      will share her personal story of forgiveness â€“ how it came into her life,
      how it changed her body, and how it became a central tenet of her healing
      and activism. Through a multimedia and interactive presentation, Leah will
      invite participants to consider: your own relationship to forgiveness, how
      your body may or may not be a ffected by that relationship, and what might
      happen if forgiveness should enter your life. Leah will share tools for
      the practice of forgiveness in personal, relational, and professional
      settings.
